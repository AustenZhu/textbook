Chapter 1: Introduction
=======================

Data are descriptions of the world around us, collected through observation and
stored on computers. Computers enable us to infer properties of the world from
these descriptions. **Data science** is the discipline of drawing conclusions from
data using computation.  The aim of this textbook is to introduce you to this
discipline.

There are three core aspects of effective data analysis: exploration, prediction, and inference.

**Exploration** involves identifying patterns in information.

**Prediction** involves using information we know to make informed guesses about values we wish we knew.

**Inference** involves quantifying our degree of certainty: will those patterns we found also appear in new observations? How accurate are our predictions?

Though any real data analysis involves all three, this introductory text is mostly about
**exploration**.  Your brain is still better than any existing computer at identifying
patterns in data, provided a computer has processed the data and displayed them in the
right form. Therefore, to explore data, you must collaborate with your computer.
Exploration is a *two-way communication task*:

* You use a **programming language** to instruct a computer to process data.
  Instructions given to computers must be simple and precise, so computer programming
  involves mathematical ideas like logic and abstraction.
* The computer **formats the results** for your brain to analyze.  Most humans are
  good at interpreting visual information like shapes and colors.  A list of 1,000 numbers
  is virtually useless, while a bar chart can convey the information in the list instantly.
  **Visualization** is the key means of computer-to-human communication about data.

This text introduces you simultaneously to both means of communication.  It
interleaves a complete introduction to programming that assumes no prior knowledge.
You will learn a small set of core data visualization techniques that will help you
explore a vast range of real-world data.  It will also prepare you for a future course
in data science, should you choose to take one.

Data science also requires careful reasoning about quantities, but this text does not
assume any background in mathematics or statistics beyond basic algebra. You will find
very few equations in this text.  Instead, you will see techniques in the
same language in which they are described to the computers that execute them - a
programming language.
