### How do we conduct a randomized controlled trial?

The method of randomization can be as simple as tossing a coin. It may also be
quite a bit more complex. But every method of randomization consists of a
sequence of carefully defined steps that allow chances to be specified
mathematically. This has two important consequences.

1. It allows us to account–mathematically–for the possibility that randomization
   produces treatment and control groups that are quite different from each
   other.

2. It allows us to make precise mathematical statements about differences
   between the treatment and control groups. This in turn helps us make
   justifiable conclusions about whether the treatment has any effect.

In this course, you will learn how to conduct and analyze your own randomized
experiments. That will involve more detail than has been presented in this
section. For now, just focus on the main idea: to try to establish causality,
run a randomized controlled experiment if possible. If you are conducting an
observational study, you might be able to establish association, but any
conclusions about causality will be on shaky ground at best.  Be extremely
careful about confounding factors before making conclusions about causality
based on an observational study.

### Why don't we conduct RCTs to answer every question?
In many situations it might not be possible to carry out a randomized controlled
experiment, even when the aim is to investigate causality. For example, suppose
you want to study the effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and you
randomly assign some pregnant women to your "alcohol" group. You should not
expect cooperation from them if you present them with a drink. In such
situations you will almost invariably be conducting an observational study, not
an experiment. Be alert for confounding factors.

### Should we ever question RCTs?
Yes!  RCTs are known as the "gold standard" for causal inference, but they are still
vulnerable to many problems unrelated to confounding factors.  For example,
because PROGRESA was an RCT, researchers could establish that the study caused an
increase in investment income among the villages studied.  But this does not
necessarily hold for *other groups* outside the study.  Cultural or other factors
might have made PROGRESA uniquely effective in rural Mexico in the 1990s.  We
cannot be absolutely sure that a similar program in rural Africa in 2017 would
work equally well.

### Fun facts and good reads

1. According to an
   [article](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2009/03/berkeley-hybrid-capital-of-california.html)
   in the LA Times citing a UCLA study by Matthew E. Kahn, the area around 
   UC Berkeley has the highest rate in California of hybrid car registration:
   5.24% in 2009.

2. In an RCT that started in 2017 in Kenya, the nonprofit GiveDirectly will give people
   in randomly-chosen villages roughly $22 per month for the next 12 years.
   You can read about it [here](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/6/14007230/kenya-basic-income-givedirectly-experiment-village).  Some people hope that direct cash payments will be more efficient
   than previous efforts at alleviating poverty.  Similar randomized studies have
   been run before, but with shorter durations.  In what ways might a long-running study
   be more informative?

   Banerjee and Esther Duflo of MIT, is an accessible and lively account of ways to
   fight global poverty. It includes numerous examples of RCTs, including the
   PROGRESA example in this section.
