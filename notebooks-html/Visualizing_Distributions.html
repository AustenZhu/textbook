<p>In this chapter we will learn about <em>distributions</em>.  Visualizations will be our primary tool for understanding and analyzing distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Terminology.</strong> A distribution is a mathematical object that tells us, for each potential value in a dataset, how often that value appears.  For example, in a bag with one white ball and one red ball, the distribution of ball colors in the bag can be described as "one white and one red."</p>
<p>A <em>frequency</em> or sometimes <em>probability</em> distribution is a distribution whose amounts have been normalized to add up to 1.  That means we divide each count by the total count, producing <em>proportions</em> of the total.  The frequency distribution of the ball colors in the bag is "$\frac{1}{2}$ white and $\frac{1}{2}$ red."  Notice that the frequency distribution doesn't tell us how many balls are in the bag.  Sometimes this is actually a desirable property.</p>
<p>When it's not clear from context whether a distribution describes counts or proportions, we will call non-frequency distributions "count distributions."</p></div></div></div>
