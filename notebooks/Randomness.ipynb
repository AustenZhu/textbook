    "In the previous chapters we developed skills needed to make insightful descriptions of data. Data scientists also have to be able to understand randomness. For example, they have to be able to assign individuals to treatment and control groups at random, and then try to say whether any observed differences in the outcomes of the two groups are simply due to the random assignment or genuinely due to the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we begin our analysis of randomness. To start off, we will use Python to make choices at random. In `numpy` there is a sub-module called `random` that contains many functions that involve random selection. One of these functions is called `choice`. It picks one item at random from an array, and it is equally likely to pick any of the items. The function call is `np.random.choice(array)`, where `array` is any array from which to make the choice.\n",

    "## Why randomness?\n",
    "Randomness has many more uses than simulating random assignments in experiments.  Another application is that random choices may be in some sense \"fair.\"  To decide who has the advantage of playing first in a game of chess, you might flip a coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more serious application of this is in jury selection.  In the United States, a defendant is supposed to have a \"jury of their peers,\" but obviously it is infeasible for every community member to judge every case.  Instead, a small group of potential jurors is selected *at random* from the whole eligible population.  We shall see later in what sense this might produce a \"representative\" panel of jurors for each trial. \n",
    "\n",
    "More immediately, we can use simulations in Python to evaluate whether potential jurors *really are* selected at random from the eligible population.  That is the topic of the next section."
