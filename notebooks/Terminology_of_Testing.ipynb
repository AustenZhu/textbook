The word \"null\" reinforces the idea that if the data look different from what the null hypothesis predicts, the difference is due to *nothing* but chance.\n",

This null hypothesis implies that, though the racial composition of the panel was different from that of the population of eligible jurors, there was no reason for the difference other than chance variation. Knowing the racial composition of the eligible population, we can simulate the panels we would get by randomly sampling from that population. So this null hypothesis does make precise assumptions about the data.\n",
