    "In this chapter we will learn about *distributions*.  Visualizations will be our primary tool for understanding and analyzing distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminology.** A distribution is a mathematical object that tells us, for each potential value in a dataset, how often that value appears.  For example, in a bag with one white ball and one red ball, the distribution of ball colors in the bag can be described as \"one white and one red.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A *frequency* or sometimes *probability* distribution is a distribution whose amounts have been normalized to add up to 1.  That means we divide each count by the total count, producing *proportions* of the total.  The frequency distribution of the ball colors in the bag is \"$\\frac{1}{2}$ white and $\\frac{1}{2}$ red.\"  Notice that the frequency distribution doesn't tell us how many balls are in the bag.  Sometimes this is actually a desirable property.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it's not clear from context whether a distribution describes counts or proportions, we will call non-frequency distributions \"count distributions.\""
